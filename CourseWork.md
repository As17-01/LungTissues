## Data

The data comes from two different sources: MedMNIST images of Chest CT and whole slide images of lung tissues from "Genomic Data Commons Data Portal" by  National Cancer Institute. The study starts with the application of Liquid neural networks to MedMNIST collection of medical images to create a solid benchmark and check the reliability of constructed models.

Whole slide images, in comparison, require 

### MedMNIST images

MedMNIST collection of images contain 6 different 3D image sets to train a model on, such as OrganMNIST3D and VesselMNIST3D. There is no strong preference which dataset to use, and in the paper I train the models on NoduleMNIST3D dataset because it is thematically close to the dataset in the second part of the study. It contains Chest CT images of size `28 × 28 × 28` with binary target. One of the benefits of using the collection include the popularity. There are a lot of papers, which use the datasets for their analysis, and there are multiple benchmarks to compare the metrics with. Another benefit is the easy usage of them by the models. The size of each image and prebuilt dataloaders allow fast experiments without any need for preprocessing. 

### Whole slide Lung Tissue images

This dataset of high-resolution lung tissue images takes aroung 250GB of space contains frozen slices of cancer. There are two of tumor types in the dataset: lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Each slide is huge and to perform the analysis, they are sliced into parts of different sizes
