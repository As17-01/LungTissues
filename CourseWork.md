## Introduction

The modern healthcare utilizes different technologies to improve patient conditions and increase the speed of a patient's recovery. One of the main components of the medical intervention include biomedical images, which allow to make more accurate diagnoses and better treatment plans. However the analysis of such images is prone to human error, which may lead to undesirable consequences such as choosing the wrong treatment and a late detection of a disease. The application of deep learning methods allows to improve the quality of the analysis by highlighting potentially troublesome samples for further human inspection. These techniques have changed the way healthcare professionals analyze and interpret complex image data, offering automated frameworks to recognize diseases in medical images. 

In recent years, the field has experienced rapid advancements in deep learning technologies. Besides other popular approaches that have emerged, the application of Liquid Neural Networks stands out as a promising possibility to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of medical image analysis. Inspired by the dynamic behavior of liquid systems, LNNs are offering a unique framework that utilizes adaptive and self-organizing neural layers to make predictions. This course work shows the potential of Liquid Neural Networks as a new deep learning technique, with a specific focus on their application to the analysis of diverse medical images.


For the analysis I used standartized MedMNIST datasets to The utilization of the MedMNIST datasets serves as a initial step in this research, providing a great source of medical image data for training and validating neural network models. MedMNIST collection of images contain 6 different 3D image sets to train a model on, such as OrganMNIST3D and VesselMNIST3D and etc. The images are already preprocessed and ready to use by a model. Also the size of the datset is relatively small. Overall, it allows to conduct fast experiments on the data to compare the quality of different architectures. 

The research question of this paper is to find which configurations of different Liquid Neural Network architectures provide with the best results. It will be compared to the current popular approaches, which are mostly convolutional neural networks. In comparison to them, the model is not only capturing the current snapshot of the data and averages the result, but includes the dynamics of the images for predictions. These datasets are widely used for experiments and model testing across different papers, which means this work will help to build a solid benchmark, which can be used by other researches.
